# ðŸ§  Project Overview
BrainWave is the flagship analytics framework developed by Ketelsen Computing, LLC, purpose-built to extract structured intelligence from drone-collected video data. Focused on high-impact applications such as parking lot monitoring, infrastructure forecasting, and spatio-temporal scene analysis, BrainWave transforms raw imagery into predictive insights through a modular pipeline of computer vision, object tracking, and graph neural network modeling.

This repository is the central workspace for BrainWaveâ€™s development â€” integrating aerial data pipelines, machine learning architectures, and deployment tooling for field-ready solutions.

Inside the Repository:
Core Modules: Reusable components for video ingestion, object detection, multi-target tracking, scene graph construction, and predictive modeling via ST-GNNs.

Projects: Dedicated directories for active deployments â€” including parking occupancy forecasting, road condition analytics, and custom client solutions.

Tools & Utilities: Scripts and utilities for batch processing, edge-device integration (e.g. DJI Matrice 30T + iPadOS), and 2.5D visualizations.

Documentation: API references, architectural diagrams, and onboarding materials for team members and contributors.

BrainWave represents Ketelsen Computingâ€™s commitment to turning drones into decision engines â€” uniting aerial data and AI to forecast, inform, and optimize.
