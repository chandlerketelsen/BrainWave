# ðŸ§  Project Overview

Welcome to the BrainWave Analytics team repository! This repository houses the collective work of the BrainWave Analytics team, focused on developing cutting-edge solutions for analyzing brainwave data. Our mission is to transform raw EEG signals into actionable insights, enabling advancements in neuroscience, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.

This repository serves as a central hub for our code, documentation, and collaborative efforts. Here you'll find:

Core Libraries: Reusable modules for data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models.

Research Projects: Dedicated directories for ongoing research initiatives, each with its own specific goals and methodologies.

Tools & Utilities: Scripts and applications to assist in development, testing, and deployment.

Documentation: Detailed guides, API references, and best practices for team members.
